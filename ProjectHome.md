This is a sister project to the Dragonfly library.  This project you're looking at hosts application-specific and user-specific command-modules which build upon the Dragonfly library.

Documentation for the command-modules available here can be found here: [Dragonfly command-module documentation](http://dragonfly-modules.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/command-modules/documentation/index.html)
